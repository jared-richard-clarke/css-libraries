# Sass Library
Included here is my personal SASS library. It consists exclusively of mixins that generate sequences of utility classes. 
I draw many of my class names and scalar values from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). 
Both are excellent frameworks, but they are often too extensive for my personal use.
